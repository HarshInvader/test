CREDITS:

[https://github.com/adobe-webplatform/Snap.svg/] for the path animation. 

Inspiration to make this gif: [https://twitter.com/mayli/status/689300456435138560]


WHAT I USED:

Editor: Sublime Text (Sometimes Atom)
Javascript: Babel
Images and Design: Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator (Both downloaded illegally).
CSS Preference: SCSS (Sassy CSS).
Desmos for reference of functions' graphs.

MOST DIFFICULT PART IN THE PROJECT:
Javascript.

Initially, it seemed SVG and animations might be difficult, but because of Snap.Svg, it was pretty easy.
Javascript however, took MUCH longer than expected to get rid of bugs, and getting it all done perfect.

CSS is always the easiest part.
