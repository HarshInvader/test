			<p>This is a free, and a very accurate stopwatch  made by <strong>Harsha</strong> & his team. You can use this stopwatch for pretty much whatever you want to use it for, but the design is under Creative Commons License by me, so you're pretty much free to do whatever you want with it (even use it commercially) provided you give me credit and money for it ;p. Have fun :) </p>
<p> The Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) files used in the making of this page (like fonts) were under the CC license by MIT, so I would like to thank them for making my job easier. </p>
